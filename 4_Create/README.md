# Setting up calculations for arbitary materials (4_Create)
Here we will learn how to set-up and run calculations for arbitary materials, knowing only the basic structure. These lessons make use of the previous tutorials, so are quite advanced.

## Purpose
  1. Design a molecule from scratch and compute its electronic properties.
  2. Use modern databases and tools to design and compute a difficult crystalline material.

## Running the exercise
  1. Run the exercises in the folder [0_Molecule](0_Molecule).
  2. Run the exercises in the folder [1_Crystal](1_Crystal).
