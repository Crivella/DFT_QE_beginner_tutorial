# DOS and Optical Properties calculations

This is a guide to perform optical properties calculation using the dos.x and pw2gw.x post-processing codes of Quantum Espresso

### Overview

In this tutoria we will see how to use the dos.x and pw2gw.x code to perform DOS optical properties calculation for different systems. We will focus on systems with different dimensionalities:
- [0D system: Germanium cluster Ge5H12](0D_Ge_cluster)
- [2D system: Graphene](2D_Graphene)
- [3D system: Bulk silicon](3D_Si_bulk)

For each case the DOS and the imaginary part of the dielectric function will be calculated. 

### Needed codes 
- pw2gw.x for the dielectric function
- dos.x for the density of states
