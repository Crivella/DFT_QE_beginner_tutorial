# DFT Tutorial 
Beginner tutorial for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations using [Quantum Espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/)(QE)[1,2]. 

## Required packages
* A working version of QE (>=6.4) needs to be installed/compiled and the executables needs to be located in the PATH environmental variable or specified manually in the variable BIN_DIR.
* A working version of gnuplot (>=5.0) (Some scripts will generate gnuplot files to plot the results. Other programs can also be used)
* A working version of XCrySDen (http://www.xcrysden.org/), a program that can visualize input and output files of QE.

## Installing/Compiling QE
* QE can be installed from repository for Debian based linux distros (e.g.: Ubuntu) by running the command
    ```
    % sudo apt-get install quantum-espresso
    ```
    PS: The latest available version is shown at: https://packages.ubuntu.com/groovy/quantum-espresso (>6.5-1)

* QE can be compiled from source:
 1. Download the desired release version from the GitHub page "https://github.com/QEF/q-e/releases". 
 2. Unzip/tar the downloaded package and go inside the folder.
 3. From terminal run the commands

     ```
     % ./configure --prefix=path for installation
     % make all
     % make install
     ```

  NOTE: options for the configuration / use of external libraries for optimized executables is beyond the purpose of this tutorial.


## Overview of exercises 
### Bulk silicon (0_Si_bulk)
  1. View an input file for a simple crystal and visualize it using xcrysden 
  2. Run a simple self-consistent calculation using pw.x
  3. Determine the convergence with respect to the kinetic energy cutoff and k-point mesh 
  4. Determine the theoretical lattice parameter
  5. Calculate a charge density and visualize it using XCrySDen
  6. Generate a high-symmetry k-path using xcrysden and calculate a band structure using a non-self-consistent calculation
  7. Calculate the density of states(DOS) and optical properties(independent particle approximation) and show the convergence over the number of k_points and empty bands used
### Two-dimensional boron nitride (1_BN)
  1. How to use a supercell in order to run calculation for material that are not periodic in all directions.
### Graphene (2_Graphene)
  1. Run calculation for a metallic/semimetallic system
### Carbon monoxide (3_CO)
  1. Run a relax calculation and visualize the output using xcrysden
  2. Run a calculaiton for a molecule (0D system)
  3. Calculate the binding energy of a molecule
  4. Visualize the HOMO and LUMO of a molecule (charge density for specific k-point and band)
  5. Use a Lennard-Jones like potential to fit the data 'E_tot' vs 'bond lenght'
